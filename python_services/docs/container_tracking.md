## How to Rectify Shipment Marked as Invalid

### Common Error Reasons and Solutions

| Reason | Explanation | Next Actionable |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Invalid Tracking Number | The tracking number is invalid as the details are not available for the number on the carrier's website. | See detailed actions below |
| Tracking number does not match the carrier format | Every carrier has a set of tracking number formats used for tracking. This error is raised when your number doesn't match it. | Please check the tracking ID again |
| Tracking no. not found on mentioned shipping line website | The tracking ID is added with the wrong carrier. | Enter the right carrier |
| Need BL no. for the complete schedule of the shipment | BL number is required to know the full schedule of the tracking. | Please try to track the shipment via BL number as the carrier doesn't provide a complete schedule from the container number |
| Carrier is not found | The carrier name is not mentioned. | See detailed actions below |
| Your entered POL and POD not matched with carrier POL and POD | POL/POD entered for the tracking does not match with the carrier's data provided. | Please check whether the entered POL/POD is correct by visiting the platform |
| Dispatch Date error | The dispatch date entered is ahead of the Gate In date given by the carrier. | Entered factory dispatch date should be before the gate-in date (fetched from the carrier) |

### Detailed Error Resolution

#### Error: Invalid Tracking Number

**Reasons why shipment might be invalid currently:**

1. **The shipment you are trying to track is a future shipment**
   - Shipments which are yet to start or starting on a later date, may not be available on the carrier's database at the time of creation.
   - You can make your shipment a future shipment by adding a dispatch date or estimated departure.

   **Actionable:**
   - Adding Dispatch Date
   - Adding Estimated Departure Date

2. **Shipment is not in a valid format**
   - Please check if the tracking number is a container. If it is, make sure that it is in the format of 4 Alphabets + 7 Digits (e.g., MAEU1234567)
   - Please check if the tracking number belongs to the right carrier

   **Actionable:**
   - Edit shipment to the right tracking number

#### Error: Tracking number does not match the carrier format / Tracking no. not found on mentioned shipping line website

**Reasons:**
- Please check if the tracking number is a container. If it is, make sure that it is of the format of 4 Alphabets + 7 Digits (e.g., MAEU1234567)
- Every carrier has a certain prefix or owner code attached to the tracking number. For example, Maersk uses MAEU and MRKU as prefixes for tracking numbers.

**Actionable:**
- Edit tracking number

#### Error: Need BL no. for the complete schedule of the shipment

**Reason:**
- Certain shipping lines like EGLV (Evergreen), BLPL, etc. only show the latest event when searched with container numbers.
- In such cases, adding a BL/Booking number will help you get the full schedule of your shipment.

**Actionable:**
- Change Container number to BL Number

#### Error: Carrier is not found

**Reason:**
- This happens when the carrier is not mentioned or not found on the platform. In such cases:
  - Either the entered carrier is misspelled
  - Carrier is not supported on the platform

**Actionable:**
- You can check the availability of existing carriers by going through the bulk upload template
- You can email support@gocomet.com
- You can also request for the carrier if not present. All you need to provide are:
  - Requested carrier name
  - A recent BL number
  - A recent container number
  - The current source of tracking: Website/call/sms/email
  - Volume (Optional: Volume of containers you deal with monthly)

#### Error: Your entered POL and POD not matched with carrier POL and POD

**Reason:**
1. Port of loading or discharge entered is different from BL. In such cases, we alert the user.
   - Note: We don't track shipments until action is taken on them.
2. Ports have changed due to delays or traffic. In such cases, we alert the user.
   - Note: We don't track shipments until action is taken on them.

**Actionable:**
- Autofix or change ports

#### Error: Factory Dispatch date error

**Reason:**
1. Users may be trying to track the next leg of the containers but the data is only present of the previous leg.
   - Our system provides a buffer of +5 days considering human error as dispatch date is not readily available.
   - We will mark the shipment yet to start if old leg data is available in the carrier's database till the dispatch date you have entered.
2. User might have entered a wrong dispatch date

**Actionable:**
- Add dispatch date before gate in date

## Understanding Carrier Ratings for GoTrack [P1, P2, P3]
[Link to solution article](https://gocomet.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/43000631963?portalId=43000006477)

GoComet's support ratings define the service level parameters for different carriers while tracking shipments on our platform (GoTrack: Enterprise Shipment Tracking solution & Container tracking free tool). These ratings are standard across all the supported modes - Air, Ocean, and Courier, Road.

Carrier support ratings are defined based on the type of Integration between GoComet & the carrier (API, EDI, Legacy platform/database integrations).

**Note**: If there is a discrepancy from carrier's data, GoComet resends the request to verify data, back to the carrier. Hence in a very few cases, you can expect the time for updation may take 12-24 hours regardless of the rating.

### Types:

1. **P1 Rating: Highest | Trusted by GoComet**
   - Marked with a P1 support rating are trusted carriers that are integrated directly for tracking updates with the GoComet Platform via API/EDI integrations
   - These carriers allow for instantaneous results in most cases providing the quickest updates
   - **Update response time**: Fastest | Typically: 1-2 minutes (In some cases: 3-6 hours), May take 12 hours if the data is not accurate from carrier

2. **P2 Rating: High | Supported by GoComet**
   - Marked with a P2 support rating are supported carriers that are integrated directly with the carrier's system for tracking updates via Legacy platform integrations
   - These integrations are unlike the state-of-the-art API/EDI integrations and provide much slower response times
   - As a result of which the total data refresh cycles are limited to 1-2 refreshes per day
   - **Update response time**: Typically: 12-24 hours

3. **P3 Rating: Medium | Smart Algorithm**
   - Carriers with a P3 rating don't have a Database or API GoComet could integrate with
   - These carriers are tracked using GoComet's ML Algorithm which identifies the ocean carriers dealing with the shipments
   - **Update response time**: Typically: 24-48 hours. In some cases, for trackings which have not started yet, data may take 4-5 days to get updated

4. **Not Supported Carriers**
   - Marked as "Not supported" are the carriers which do not support direct integration either due to poor/no IT architecture to support shipment tracking or strict no data-sharing policies (these carriers typically allow shippers to track shipments with a secure login ID)
   - Carriers that do not qualify with the minimum levels of data standards as per our policy after the evaluation period is also marked as "Not Supported"
